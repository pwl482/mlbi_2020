## Task
Develope a ML approach to predict cancer(type) vs healthy patient samples from RNAseq data of blood platelets:
[SMARTER seq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68086)

## Dependencies
- a shell with git functionality:
    - either on a unix based System probably preinstalled (Linux/Mac)
    - or a Windows git extension, like using the anaconda prompt to install and run git commands
- python (probably python 3) with:
    - anaconda or another variant of the conda environment manager
    - jupyter notebooks (comes preinstalled with anaconda)

## Installation and Data
- navigate to a directory of choice for installation in the shell
- run the following (this will download the nescessary GEO Data and Paper supplements and setup a conda environment with the nescessary dependencies):

```console
$ bash setup.sh
```


## How to run

- open jupyter notebooks
```console
$ jupyter notebooks
```
