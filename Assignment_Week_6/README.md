# Assignment Week 6

[[_TOC_]]

## Task
Develop three ML classifier for solving the variant call refinement problem,
using data available here:
[DeepSVR/data](https://github.com/griffithlab/DeepSVR/tree/master/data)

## Dependencies
- a shell with git functionality:
    - either on a unix based System probably preinstalled (Linux/Mac)
    - or a Windows git extension, like using the anaconda prompt to install and run git commands
- python (probably python 3) with:
    - anaconda or another variant of the conda environment manager
    - jupyter notebooks (comes preinstalled with anaconda)

## Installation and Data
- navigate to a directory of choice for installation in the shell
- run the following:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/griffithlab/DeepSVR.git
$ cd DeepSVR
```

- move the file: [ANN_with_feature_importance.ipynb](https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/pvjet86/mlbi-2020/-/blob/master/%20Assignment_Week_6/ANN_with_feature_importance.ipynb) into the previously created directory "DeepSVR"
- move the file: [PCR_with_feature_importance.ipynb](https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/pvjet86/mlbi-2020/-/blob/master/%20Assignment_Week_6/PCR_with_feature_importance.ipynb) into the previously created directory "DeepSVR"
- move the file: [SVM_with_feature_importance.ipynb](https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/pvjet86/mlbi-2020/-/blob/master/%20Assignment_Week_6/SVM_with_feature_importance.ipynb) into the previously created directory "DeepSVR"


## How to run

- open jupyter notebooks
- open the notebook: [ANN_with_feature_importance.ipynb](https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/pvjet86/mlbi-2020/-/blob/master/%20Assignment_Week_6/ANN_with_feature_importance.ipynb) and run it
- open the notebook: [PCR_with_feature_importance.ipynb](https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/pvjet86/mlbi-2020/-/blob/master/%20Assignment_Week_6/PCR_with_feature_importance.ipynb) and run it
- open the notebook: [SVM_with_feature_importance.ipynb](https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/pvjet86/mlbi-2020/-/blob/master/%20Assignment_Week_6/SVM_with_feature_importance.ipynb) and run it
